# Tableau COVID-19 Dashboard
In this project, we use Tableau and the Johns Hopkins data set tracking COVID-19 cases across the globe to build a comprehensive animated dashboard (using Tableau Pages). The features and visualizations used in this dashboard include the following:
- Bar Chart
- GeoMap
- Line Chart

**A preview of the dashboard is shown below:**
